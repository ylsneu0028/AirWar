## Introduction
Air War is a classic shooting game with aircraft as the model. Players control the hero plane to dodge enemy planes and enemy bullets, and shoot down enemy planes. Buffs may drop at any time during the game, and players can increase their health and firepower after receiving buffs. The game process will calculate the player's score, and the player wins after reaching a certain score. If the player is shot down by an enemy plane before winning, with a health value of 0, the game fails.
